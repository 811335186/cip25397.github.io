With every end of Thanksgiving day sparks the biggest shopping day of the year, <i>Black Friday</i>. In multiple of classes I have taken in my minor of Fashion Merchandising, we have studied this important holiday and following trends of earlier advertisements, earlier opening hours, and increased sales. 
</p>
<p>
Despite recent years backlash over this controversial holiday, more than 170 million shoppers participated in Black Friday in 2017, according to the National Retail Federation. This trend has not gone unnoticed among retailers, as they are adjusting their advertisment campaigns dates to adhere to this trend. Advertisments are being seen as soon as October 1 and the week of November 10 for major retailers like Target, Macy's, and Best Buy. These stores along with other major names are opening even earlier this year to respond to customers' wishes. Here are some projections for the 2018 season of projected store openings in comparison to 2017 for major retailers.

<p>
2017 in store sales increased by an incredible 4% demonstrating that despite the increase in Cyber Monday sales, this holiday is only still becoming more successful. In fact, 2018 predictions of sales shows the greatest increase in money spent per shopper of a shocking <b> $1,007.24 </b>. This holiday has never reached 4 digits in sales per customer! What a time for the market! </p>
